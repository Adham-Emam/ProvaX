            <h2>Why <span>ProvaX?</span></h2>
            <p>
              Shopping for clothes online has become increasingly popular, with
              many customers preferring the convenience of online shopping over
              visiting physical stores. However, this convenience often comes
              with challenges. Customers may feel frustrated when they receive
              their orders and find that the items do not fit as expected or
              look different from what they imagined.
            </p>
            <p>
              This frustration can lead to cancelled orders and dissatisfaction
              with the shopping experience. At ProvaX, we offer a solution to
              this problem. By integrating our platform into your online store,
              you can provide customers with the ability to virtually try on
              clothes before making a purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              This not only enhances the shopping experience but also increases
              customer satisfaction and engagement. With ProvaX, you can empower
              your customers to make confident purchasing decisions, leading to
              fewer returns and higher sales.
